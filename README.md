Keeping track of everyday tasks in your head can become quite **unbearable** and **stressful**.

Attempting to be efficient everyday should not be **burdened** by having to memorize all of your ongoing tasks.

<br />

Utilize this application to: 
* Organize your life and keep track of your priorities.
* Clear your headspace, take some weight off your mind. 
* Improve mood, knocking off tasks you needed to complete is a great feeling. 

<br />


This project was built with: 

* [Vanilla JS](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5)
* [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
